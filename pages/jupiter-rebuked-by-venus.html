        <h2 class="section-title">About This Painting</h2>
        <p>
          This painting shows a scene from classical mythology: Venus reproaches her father Jupiter for his infidelity to Juno. Venus stands at the center, gesturing toward Jupiter, who reclines among other gods and figures. The composition uses diagonal lines, strong contrasts of light and shadow, and expressive gestures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paolo de Matteis painted this work in Naples around 1706-1710. He trained in the tradition of Luca Giordano. The painting follows the grand manner style—large scale, mythological subject, and dramatic presentation. The scene includes cupids and other mythological figures arranged around the central confrontation.
        </p>
        <p>
          De Matteis uses chiaroscuro to create depth, with light falling on the main figures while others remain in shadow. The drapery shows careful attention to folds and movement. The color palette emphasizes reds, golds, and flesh tones typical of Italian Baroque mythological scenes.

        <h2 class="section-title">Baroque Context</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            The Baroque period lasted roughly from 1600 to 1750. Artists used dynamic compositions, dramatic lighting, and strong emotion. Large-scale mythological and religious paintings were common, especially for court and church patrons.
          </p>
          <p>
            De Matteis uses typical Baroque techniques here: diagonal composition, strong chiaroscuro, and expressive gestures. The figures' poses and expressions convey emotion and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mythological subjects were popular in European courts and academies. These paintings showed the patron's education and classical knowledge. The story of Venus rebuking Jupiter would have been familiar to educated viewers who knew classical mythology.

        <h2 class="section-title">Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Created during the twilight of the Baroque era, this painting
          represents the continuation of grand manner painting traditions in
          early 18th-century Naples. De Matteis was one of the leading painters
          in Naples during this period, working for both religious institutions
          and aristocratic patrons across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work demonstrates the international character of Baroque art,
          with influences from Roman, Venetian, and Neapolitan painting
          traditions. Its theatrical quality and emphasis on narrative clarity
          made such mythological scenes popular among educated viewers who could
          appreciate both the technical skill and the classical references.
