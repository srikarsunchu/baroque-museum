        <h2 class="section-title">About This Painting</h2>
        <p>
          This painting depicts the young David holding the severed head of the giant Goliath, a scene from the biblical story in which the shepherd boy defeats the Philistine warrior. Caravaggio painted this work near the end of his life, around 1609-1610, while seeking papal pardon for murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The composition is remarkable for its dramatic lighting and psychological intensity. David emerges from deep shadows, his face reflecting a complex mixture of compassion and sorrow rather than triumph. The head of Goliath is believed to be a self-portrait of Caravaggio himself, making this painting both a religious narrative and a deeply personal statement about guilt, mortality, and redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caravaggio's revolutionary use of chiaroscuro—the strong contrast between light and dark—reaches its peak in this work. The dramatic lighting creates a powerful focal point on the two faces while the background dissolves into darkness. The naturalistic detail and emotional authenticity reject idealization in favor of raw human truth.
        </p>

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Caravaggio stands as one of the most influential figures of the Baroque period. His innovative approach to painting—using dramatic lighting, everyday models, and unidealized realism—revolutionized European art. This painting exemplifies his mature style, where technical virtuosity serves psychological and emotional depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work demonstrates the Baroque fascination with dramatic moments and intense emotion. Unlike Renaissance paintings that emphasized beauty and idealization, Caravaggio presents raw human experience. The painting's dark mood and introspective quality reflect both Baroque spirituality and the artist's personal circumstances as a fugitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            This painting influenced countless artists across Europe. Caravaggio's technique of using sharp light to illuminate figures against dark backgrounds became known as "tenebrism" and was adopted by painters from Naples to the Netherlands. His naturalistic approach challenged academic conventions and opened new possibilities for religious and secular painting.

        <h2 class="section-title">Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          This painting represents one of Caravaggio's final works, created during his exile from Rome. The artist fled the city in 1606 after killing a man in a brawl and spent his remaining years seeking papal forgiveness while moving between Naples, Malta, and Sicily. The self-portrait as Goliath suggests the painting may have been intended as a gift to secure his pardon—a symbolic offering of his own head.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work's psychological complexity makes it stand out even among Caravaggio's dramatic oeuvre. Rather than celebrating military victory, it presents a meditation on violence, mortality, and human frailty. David's melancholic expression suggests empathy for his defeated enemy, creating a nuanced emotional narrative rare in depictions of this biblical story. This introspective quality, combined with the possible self-portrait, gives the painting an autobiographical dimension that resonates beyond its religious subject matter.
