        <p>
          "After the Bullfight" captures a moment of respite and conversation
          in the aftermath of a Spanish bullfight. Mary Cassatt, an American
          painter who spent most of her career in France, created this work
          during her early period when she was exploring European subjects and
          traditions. The painting depicts a toreador in his elaborate costume
          alongside elegantly dressed spectators.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work demonstrates Cassatt's early engagement with Spanish themes,
          a subject popularized by earlier artists such as Édouard Manet. The
          dramatic lighting and rich color palette show the influence of both
          Spanish painting traditions and the grand manner of Baroque art.
          Cassatt's attention to costume details and the psychological
          interaction between figures reveals her keen observational skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          The composition places viewers as intimate witnesses to a private
          moment, characteristic of Realist painting but with the dramatic
          lighting effects inherited from Baroque traditions. The contrast
          between the brilliance of the matador's costume and the darker
          surroundings creates a theatrical effect that draws the eye to the
          central figures.

          <p>
            While created in the late 19th century, "After the Bullfight" draws
            heavily on Baroque compositional and lighting techniques. The dramatic
            chiaroscuro, rich color palette, and theatrical presentation of the
            subject reflect the enduring influence of Baroque masters like
            Velázquez and Caravaggio on subsequent generations of artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Baroque tradition emphasized drama, emotion, and the capture of
            significant moments. Cassatt's painting, though more intimate in
            scale than grand Baroque works, employs similar strategies: the strong
            contrast of light and shadow, the careful attention to fabric and
            texture, and the psychological depth of the figures all echo Baroque
            concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spanish Baroque painting, particularly the work of Velázquez, had a
            profound influence on 19th-century artists. The combination of
            realism, dramatic lighting, and dignified presentation of subjects
            found in Spanish Golden Age painting informed Cassatt's approach to
            this work, creating a bridge between Baroque traditions and modern
            artistic sensibilities.

        <h2 class="section-title">Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          This painting was created during Cassatt's formative years as an
          artist, when she was studying the works of Old Masters in European
          museums and developing her distinctive style. Spain and Spanish
          subjects were popular among progressive artists of the period,
          representing both exotic appeal and connection to the great painting
          traditions of Velázquez and Goya.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work demonstrates Cassatt's versatility beyond the domestic
          scenes and mother-child compositions for which she later became
          famous. It reveals her engagement with dramatic subject matter and
          her ability to work within established painterly traditions while
          bringing her own modern sensibility to the composition.
